Data augmentation on Alexnet using shifts, rotate, horixzontal flip and zoom
changes:

Key Changes Implemented:
Preprocessing Single Image:

Defined preprocess_image() function to preprocess individual images.
Data Augmentation with ImageDataGenerator:

Applied rotation, zoom, horizontal flip, width/height shifts, and shear transformations.
Used fill_mode='nearest' to handle empty pixels generated during transformations.
Training and Evaluation:

Replaced the training dataset with train_dataset_augmented.
The validation dataset uses rescaling without augmentation.
