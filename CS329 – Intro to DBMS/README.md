CS329 — Intro to DBMS

Overview

This folder contains teaching materials for an introductory database course. It includes concise lecture notes, small runnable examples (SQL + Python), practice exercises, and a few project skeletons that students can use as assignments or class projects.

Structure

- notes/         — short lecture summaries
- examples/      — small SQL example files and runnable snippets
- projects/      — project skeletons (library-db, ecommerce-db)
- practice/      — practice exercises and problem sets
- resources/     — cheat sheets, tutorial links, textbooks, videos

How to run the examples

Most SQL examples use SQLite and can be run with the builtin `sqlite3` CLI or via Python's `sqlite3` module. The `examples/python` folder contains small Python scripts that create and query an example DB.
